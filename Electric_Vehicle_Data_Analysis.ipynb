    "## Project Description:\n",
    "Electric vehicles have grown quite popular over the last decade due to its cleanliness and a good mileage of batteries. One of the attractive features of electric vehicles is that these are environmental friendly as these emit less air pollutants. Electricity is also available due to the contributions of the nuclear power plants and geothermal energies. This project deals with information about the electric vehicles over the last 25 years. The dataset was collected from [data.gov](https://data.gov/)."

    "```CHEVROLET``` was the ```first``` company to produce an electric car. CHEVROLET was followed by FORD and TOYOTA. However, the electric range increased significantly when TESLA started producing electric car in 2008. That is one of the reasons why TESLA cars are so popular among the electric cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the graph, it is clearly visible that car production took a huge step after 2011. All the car companies produced significant share of their cars from 2011 onwards. Also, the electric range of the cars is distributed within the range 0-337. These data only represent the cars whose eligibility is known. Without knowing the battery range, it would not be wise to include the unknown eligibility data during ranking. Hence, while ploting the graph, those data have been eliminated. Taking all these observations into considerations, we will now make a model to rank the electric cars."

So, giving weight values $w_{b} = 0.2$ to the ranking score before 2011 and  $w_{a} = 0.8$ to the ranking score after 2011, we can express the overall ranking score $R_{overall}$ as,\n",
